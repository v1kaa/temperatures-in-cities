# temperatures-in-cities
 CPython script that allows users to retrieve weather information for a specific city. The script interacts with two APIs: api-ninjas for obtaining city data and OpenWeatherMap for fetching real-time temperature.

 City Data Retrieval: Enter the name of a city to obtain relevant details such as latitude, longitude, and other information using the api-ninjas API.

Temperature Information: The script then utilizes OpenWeatherMap to fetch the current temperature in Kelvin for the specified city.

Conversion Functionality: Includes a function to convert temperatures from Kelvin (the unit used by OpenWeatherMap) to Celsius.
